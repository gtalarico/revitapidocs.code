/*
Make a selection of objects in view filtering by category 
This works just as Filter Selection but in Reverse. It allows you to first select the Category of the Selection by 
picking up an Object of that Category and follow up with a standard rectangular selection. After finishing the selection, only 
objects from that Category will be selected.
TESTED REVIT API: 2018
The snippet can be used as is in a Revit Application Macro for test purposes
